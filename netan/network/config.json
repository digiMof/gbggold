Then, each type is divided in classes: for what concerns the Places we have Ferrara, Bologna and the Adriatic Region; for what concerns the characters, we have different social classes and roles.\nIt is therefore possible to infer new connections and relations between the entities of the book and, by comparing it to Fadigati\u0027s second network, to understand how it changes.",

Athos Fadigati before his outing (at the end of chapter 2).\nClick on a node to see its connections or select different classes representing the book\u0027s communities: for places (Ferrara, Bologna or Adriatic locations) and people (historical and cultural characters, the group of students, the narrator\u0027s family, characters belonging to and representing the bourgeoisie and \"others\").",
