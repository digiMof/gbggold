### A few practical things still to be implemented in the website:
- Add a slight dark shadow under the text of the navbar (before the white-background animation)
- Changing the colour of the fading "LENSES" text in the title to goldenrod (#DAA520)
- Add some more space between the title and the subtitle

Secondary changes:
- Add dropdown menu from Methodologies (navbar)
- Get rid of the underline of links
