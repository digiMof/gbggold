                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>Gli occhiali d'oro</i> by Giorgio Bassani plays a crucial role within the Italian narrative tradition of the aftermath of the Second World War. The book was published in 1958 and constitutes the second section of the series <i>Il romanzo di Ferrara</i>. As it has been often pointed out (among the others, <a href="#Ferroni13">Ferroni 2013: 77</a>), the author stresses the theme of historical memory and contextualises it within the geographical scenario of the city of Ferrara. The chronotope of the plot is indeed the Emilian city during the late Thirties and, similarly to the masterpiece <i>Il giardino dei Finzi-Contini</i>, describes the difficult situation experienced by Jewish communities in Italy during Fascism. Albeit the novel seems to deepen a crucial theme for the poetics of the author, it also deals with an unprecedented topic: the homophobic discrimination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The protagonist of <i>Gli occhiali d'oro</i> is indeed Athos Fadigati, a well-known otolaryngologist working in Ferrara. The first chapters of the book are aimed at describing the bourgeois milieu of the small city and to provide the reader a portrait of the doctor. This harmonious balance is however fragile: already at the end of the second chapter a plot twist takes place:
                    <blockquote>
                        «Non lo sai? Mi risulta che il dottor Fadigati è...» «Sta' a sentire la novità. Conosci mica quel dottor Fadigati, che abita in Gorgadello, quasi all'angolo con Bersaglieri del Po? Ebbene, ho sentito dire che è...»
                    </blockquote>
                    From this moment the reader witnesses an hasher and harsher discrimination towards Fadigati. Indeed, his "inversione sessuale" is radically incompatible with the righteous principle of the Fascist bourgeoisie. This discrimination will progressively exclude and marginalise the protagonist, whose story cannot turn but into a tragedy. In fact, this unbearable burden will force Fadigati to drown himself in the suburbs of Ferrara, at Pontelagoscuro.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire story is described from an internal observer, who works as emotive filter on the entire plot. The narrator is indeed a Jewish middle-class young adult (maybe Bassani himself?): this character, however, cannot be identified by a name, as it is referenced quite exclusively by personal pronouns throughout the book. Acerbi and Faré <a href="#CassoBassa">(1966: 185)</a> proposed a valid description of the narratological strategy implemented by Bassani in the book.
                    <blockquote>
                       A partire da <i>Gli occhiali d'oro</i> si apre la strada del puro intimismo, ponendosi come unico interesse l'analisi delle reazioni psicologiche individuali. La piu significativa innovazione e l'introduzione di un io narrante che, da elemento del coro intorno al dott. Fadigati, si fa personalità di rilievo sempre maggiore in rapporto con il protagonista, e con l'ambiente sociale, e in cui la personalità dell'autore si fonde e si immedesima con quella della sua creatura fantastica. Ne consegue la riduzione dei personaggi a quanto il giovane, che fa da narratore, coglie nel rapporto individuale, senza che questi vengano costruiti per convergenza di più punti di vista [...]. Ma poi il giovane protagonista si fa, da semplice osservatore e testimonio, partecipe del dramma del dottore [...]: è un incontro di perseguitati, per una analogia di condizioni tra il dottore e il giovane ebreo, che si accorge, attraverso i trasalimenti della sua vivissima sensibilita, di essere egli pure condannato ed esiliato dalla vita per la sola colpa di essere d'un'altra stirpe
                    </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire novel is therefore centered on the theme of the marginalisation and the segregation caused by the Fascist regime. Albeit the plot unfolds in several settings, the tragedy of Fadigati (and of the narrator as well) is mainly framed by the city of Ferrara. This place is treated as a living scenario, continuously shaped by the interaction among the main characters and secondary background. The description of the city in Bassani has a crucial role: already at the first page, each event and character is centered in well defined  geographical dimension. This choice allows to track movements and change of habits of different characters along the plot as any micro-story is effectively part of the "romanzo di Ferrara".

                <h3>2. Methodologies</h3>
                <p>
                    As highlighted above, <i>Gli occhiali d'oro</i> deals as primary theme the discrimination and the exclusion of the individual from and by its own social class. Indeed, in the novel multiple elements collaborate in depicting the marginalisation of protagonist and of the narrator: the sense of emergination and claustrophobia described at the end of the book is self-evident and can be percieved alredy at a first, naïve reading. The goal of the project is indeed to study how this marginalisation process unfolds during the plot and which axes can be considered as effective paramenter to measure it. The following research question can be formalized:
                </p>
                <div class="featured-text text-lg-left">
                    <h5 style="font-style: italic;" class="text-center">How can marginalisation be visualized and studied in Bassani's "Gli occhiali d'oro"?</h4>
                    <p><b>I.</b> How are the characters connected to each other?</p>
                    <p><b>II.</b> How does Fadigati's network change after his outing?</p>
                    <p><b>III.</b> How does Fadigati's relationship with the urban space change after his outing?</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We do think that studying the marginalization strategies described in the novel can be a useful purpose to better understand the art of Bassani and his cultural milieu as well. The marginalisation of the narrator, "in cui la personalità dell'autore si fonde e si immedesima con quella della sua creatura fantastica", and the insistence of the theme of discrimination within the <i>opera omnia</i> by Bassani (e.g. <i>Giardino dei Finzi-Contini</i>) highlight its crucial role within the poetics of the author. The possibility that this interest could be based on an autobiographical motif encourages this direction of research. Indeed, it has been said that "understanding marginality as position and place of resistance is crucial for oppressed [...] people: [...] these margins have been both sites of repression and sites of resistance" <a href="#bellhooks">(bell hooks 2015: 232)</a>. The research questions want hence to scrutinize how the theme of the margin is dealt by Bassani and which are the strategies implemented to describing the claustrophobic discrimination witnessed by the protagonist and the narrator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The adressing of these specific goals shaped the purpose of the entire project. "Changing lenses", indeed, can be read as a project of editorialization, defined as the process referring "how tools, emerging practices, and the structures determined by the tools engender a different relationship to the content itself". It also "shapes and structures content in a way that is not limited to a closed, well-defined context (such as a journal) or a group of predetermined individuals (editors and publishers). It involves an opening up of space (several platforms) and time (several different editors unbound by deadlines)" <a href="#Editor">(Vitali-Rosati 2018: 64)</a>. The processual nature of the project is witnessed by the collaboration among the team members and by the fact that its final structure was never taken for granted. On the contrary, it was continuously re-negotiated to indentify and change the methodologies according to the obtained initial results. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This magmatic and changing phisionomy of the project was deemed essential to shape the content of "Changing lenses", i.e. its relationship and practices. Among several other authors, Cristina Campo <a href="#campo">(2014: 90)</a> stresses the metaphor of the text as a carpet (the Latin <i>textus</i> derives indeed from <i>texere</i>, to sew). "Si dilata sotto i nostri occhi l’immemoriale geografia del tappeto”, observes the writer. It can be argued that "Changing lenses" wants at first to provide a general overview of this literary "carpet", highlighting relevant motifs and elements. Secondly, it follows two relevant wefts, which were considered as valid starting point to perform our analysis: the interaction between the characters and the urban space and the relationship within all the characters of the book. In this perspective, "Changing Lenses" does not aim at a mere translation into a digital environment of the reference text, rather it proposes to the reader an "architecture of object" <a href="#MancPier">(Mancinelli and Pierazzo 2020: 45)</a> that allows to explore the margin depicted in the novel from different points of view, or better changing the lenses through which text is read.
                </p>
                <div class="paridx" id="parSDE">
                    <h4>2.1. Semantic Digital Edition</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the core functionalities of “Changing lenses” is the presence of a Semantic Digital Edition of the novel by Bassani. The methodological approach is directly drawn from Sahle <a href="#Sahle16">(2016: 28)</a>, who stresses how “scholarly digital edition” (SDE) are “guided by a digital paradigm in their theory, method and practice”. The scholarly nature of the publication is granted by the reference edition, cited in the disclaimer below. Moreover, the edition is thought as a product per se born and structured within a digital ecosystem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In particular, this digital nature is strictly bound with the guidelines of the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/P5/">Text Encoding Initiative</a>. The entire book was transcribed through a supervised OCR and imported into a XML document, which was structured according to this model. Among the suggested elements, two main sections were implemented: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>&ltparticDesc&gt and &ltsettingDesc&gt in the header, combined with the use of &ltpersName&gt and &ltplaceName&gt in the body, referenced with @ref</li>
                            <li>&ltxenoData&gt which allows to enhance a scholarly digital edition with linked open data. Indeed, this section of the TEI P5 guidelines allows to declare for instance authority files. The description of the entity relied on four main authorities
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b><a href="http://viaf.org/">VIAF</a></b>: for historical figures and relevant monuments (e.g. Ferrara Cathedral)</li>
                                    <li><b><a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a></b>: gazeteer used to describe the majority of the mentioned places</li>
                                    <li><b><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</a></b>: to cover all those people and places which were mentioned neither by VIAF nor by Geonames </li>
                                </ul>
                            Places and peoples were also catalogued in the proper classes according to the ontology <b><a href="https://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a></b> (foaf:Person) and <b><a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/ontology/">DBPedia</a></b> (dbo:Place). All the namespace of the used ontologies, authorities and gazeteers are declared in the &ltTEI&gt tag.
                            </li>
                        </ul>  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The implementation of LOD, which can be defined as "the technical method of linking structure data [providing] an invaluable tool for bolting together structure information" <a href="#Oldman">(Oldman et al. 267)</a>, changes the epistemological approach of the digital edition. In describing the edition of <a href="https://projects.dharc.unibo.it/bufalini-notebook/"></a><i>Il quaderno di Paolo Bufalini</i></a>, Daquino, Giovannetti and Tomasi <a href="#bufalini">(2019: 51)</a> stresses how:
                            <blockquote>Il processo di transizione dell’edizione digitale da XML/TEI (modello ad albero) a LOD (modello a grafo) impone un’attenta analisi del testo e dell’informazione in esso contenuta iniziando dal modello di markup XML/TEI messo a punto dall’editore. Si tratta di un’operazione concettuale ancor prima che tecnica, che implica una visione del testo ‘dall’alto’, non come sequenza di dati ma come rete di relazioni.</blockquote>
                        The implementation of this technology, indeed, allows to stress relevant entities, playing hence a crucial role in answering specific research questions (see later, e.g. §2.2). Moreover, referencing every place and historical figure (when possible) enhance the reading experience: in particular for what concerns &ltpersName&gts, this semantic SDE allows to grasp also the cultural and political milieu both of the plot and of Bassani himself. To make an example, the prevalence of Wagner among other mentioned composers could provide fruitful food for thought for instance to scrutinize the relationship between Bassani and the music.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Lastly, we hope that "Changing lenses" could be considered as a valid contribution in understanding a masterpiece of Italian contemporary novelist canon, such as Bassani, from unprecedented perspectives. However, this endavour cannot be considered as <i>per se</i> sufficient, but it both relies on precedent (also analogical) studies on the novel and on the methodologies, and hopes to contribute in deepening the knowledge of this field of textual scholarship. With this hope, the issue of data reusability was crucial for us as it could lay the basis for further researches. Consequently, as this documentation also aims at showing, this SDE follows the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>, i. e. Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assests <a href="#fair">(Wilkinson et al. 2016)</a>. The development of a semantic edition and the description of the used source file, scripts, as well as its publication on an online medium, should be hence read also in this perspective.

                        The marked-up text described in §2.1. can provide useful data to understand and study the geographical dimension of <i>Gli occhiali d'oro</i>. The maps above visualizes the progressive marginalization of the protagonist and the narrator, yet describe from a quantitative point of view neither the attention paid by the author to give the reader geographical coordinates of the plot nor the relevance of this shit from the centre to the suburbs. To answer this sub-questions, data were extracted from the TEI/XML marked up text through a XQuery transformation (see §2.1).

                                    This first graph compares chapter by chapter the number of &ltpersName&gt and &ltplaceName&gt tags. Even though these values cannot be considered extremely precise (the mark up was made manually and some entities might be unintentionally be skipped), they still reflect a relevant trend. Indeed, comparing to the distribution of &ltplaceName&gt tags, &ltpersName&gt ones show a shift in the peaks. The highest values of the curve of &ltplaceName&gt can be seen almost exclusively in the change of setting, as if the author wanted before to describe the place of the story and then populate it with his characters. The geographical dimension is hence proved to be crucial in the poetics of Bassani, which hence encourage further spatial analyses.</p>

                                    To make an example: besides the map, the distribution of central and peripherical places can be measured with the support of other methodologies. A second XQuery has been developed to collect all the reference to Ferrarese places in the chapters with this Emilian city has primary setting. These values can be hence compared calculating percentual rates and visualize the distribution as follows. The category of center and periphery have been populated as follows (the toponyms are in Italian):

                                    This graph is extremely eloquent has it shows how the "first act" of this little Italian tragedy (first two chapters) takes place exclusively in the city centre, hence suggesting a full harmony between the protagonist and the social class he belongs to. Only with his outing (chapter 3) the periphery starts being mentioned and, after the summer on the Adriatic coast in the autumn of 1937, the two areas of the city ends up being in an almost perfect balance. Such a rapid increase witnesses how fast the descrimination of the character happens, which is also reflected by the plot. Less than a year after the outing, the protagonist decides to suicide, as it was given no other solution to cope with the claustrophobic judgment of the righteous Fascist bourgeoisie.

                    <h5>Research Question</h5>
                    <p>Starting from our corpora (a full edition of Bassani's "Gli Occhiali d'Oro", carefully edited and
                        tagged according to TEI guidelines), our network analysis was guided by a main research
                        question:
                        <!-- Research Question highlighted -->
                    <div class="featured-text text-center text-lg-left">
                        <h5 style="font-style: italic;">How does Fadigati's network of people change before and after
                            the discovery of his sexuality?</h4>
                            <p> !!!!! WE MAY NEED TO ADD NODES SPECIFYING MORE THE TRAITS OF PEOPLE TO DEIFNE THEM
                                BETTER !!!!! </p>
                    </div>
                    <h5>Connection definition</h5>
                    <p>After defining the Research Question, we have worked on <i>defining</i> the connections between
                        characters in the written text and with regards to our project's corpora and scope. Working with
                        a literary text would suggest that connections between characters are established whenever there
                        are dialogues between them or when they appear in the same sentence (this circumstance being
                        either a direct interaction between two characters or an indirect one, whenever a third
                        character compares the first two).</p>
                    <p>After a first attempt at tackling this problem, the particular structure of Bassani's "Gli
                        Occhiali d'Oro" made it difficult to consider the coexistence of characters inside a sentence a
                        sufficient condition for defining a relation between them: while testing the Python script used
                        to detect the characters in isolated sentences, many times there would be only one character,
                        making it impossible to infer any relation.</p>
                    <p>Hence, we have considered, as the condition for establishing connections between characters,
                        their coexistence in the <b>same paragraph</b>.</p>
                    <h5>Graph building</h5>
                    <p>After the definition of "connection", a Python script was developed to retrieve the occurrences
                        of different characters inside the same paragraph (mainly by using Regular Expressions) and to
                        build a CSV file containing such information. The CSV was then used to <b>visualise the
                            graph</b> by means of Gephi.</p>
                    <p>As our research question focuses on <i>how</i> Fadigati's social network changes before and after
                        the discovery of his sexuality, it was crucial for us to distinguish between these two moments
                        in our starting corpora (the literary text).</p>
                    <p>Two different sub-corpora were then created:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first sub-corpora comprising the first two chapters</li>
                        <li>The second sub-corpora spanning from Chapter 3 to Chapter 18</li>
                    </ul>
                    The script was then run twice on the two different sub-corpora to obtain two different graphs
                    representing the two different social networks.
                    <!-- Here img 1 -->
                    <!-- Here img 2 -->
                    </p>
                    <p>It is worth pointing out how the two graphs vary also because of the different size of the
                        sub-corporas: after a brief introduction to the context and the characters in the first two
                        chapters, Fadigati's sexuality is immediately pointed out and becomes the center of the story,
                        being the talk of the town.</p>
                    <p>By comparing the two graphs we can already see some differences between the two social networks.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the first case...</li>
                        <li>While in the second...</li>
                    </ul>
                    It is therefore clear how the discovery of Fadigati's sexuality and his successive behaviour
                    influence his network, which starts pulling away from him and changes drastically to such an extent
                    that, at the end of the book, the only character that really feels close to the doctor and
                    empathises with him is the narrator himself.</p>
